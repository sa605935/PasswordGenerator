Creates custom randomized passwords

Unit 3 Homework Assignment

https://sa605935.github.io/PasswordGenerator/ 

In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a new and secure password for the user who wished to increase security and meets specific and maliable criteria. We were given reference screenshots as guides and were encouraged to achieve the following: polished interface, responsive browser & generate passwords that include special characters.

I was able to achieve all three initiative as well as the minimum requirements below... 
Project Requirements (as listed on the actual assignment repository)
-When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, the user is prompted with a series of options to control the password criteria.
-The user is able to select only the criteria they need when prompted.
-The following are the type of individual criteria that the user can select to apply to their password: password length of 8 to 128 characters, character types including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and/or special characters.
-The user must select some password criteria in order for any password to be generated and the script notes all of their responses in order to create a password.
-When the password is created, it reflects all of the user's criteria choices.
-Then the password is displayed on the screen.

I found this project to be simple compared to some of the things we are doing in class. It is hard to make things from scratch and this project had little room for creativity. I think javascript is very interesting and I am excited to learn more. I used a lot of secondary resources to complete this project including Youtube and Codeacademy.
